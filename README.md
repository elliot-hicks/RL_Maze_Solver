# RL_Maze_Solver
RL_Maze_Solver will demonstrate the ability of reinforcement learning (specifically Q-learning) by randomly generating 2D mazes and tasking an agent to find its most efficient solution.


Give some brief background and describe what you intend your code to do, together with a rough outline (e.g., classes, functions, snippets, comments, pseudocode).
